Simple raycaster using SFML

![Screenshot](screenshot.png)

Currently just 1 file(src/main.cpp), but planning to add more features and if it gets large I'll split it up.

I based this on the raycasting tutorial at http://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html
I was inspired after seeing https://github.com/TheMozg/awk-raycaster on the Github popular projects list. I thought if someone can make a raycaster in less than 700 lines of AWK code, I could do it with C++ and SFML.

Released under GNU GPLv3, see also [LICENSE](LICENSE). Though some code is taken from the raycasting tutorial and copyright by Lode Vandevenne. Its license is in [LICENSE.tutorial](LICENSE.tutorial). I've improved and SFML-ified many parts, but the basic calculations often use the same code.

The project uses the Open Sans font, which is under the [Apache license](data/font/Apache License.txt).
